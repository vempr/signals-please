# Signals, Please!

is a game made in Godot. Your role is the commander, the sole leader of the last functioning outpost after the network collapse.
All external contact comes through your Signal Terminal and for every incoming request, you must decide whether or not to trust them.

## How this game works

You decide who to let through the border.

Your resources are limited: rations, security, morale. You can survive hunger longer than your people, but your reputation determines whether they continue to follow you.

You must survive for *ten days*. After that, the N.A.L. ALLIES, the nearest surviving federation, will reach your borders to unite with your region. Until then, you stand alone, a flickering light in the dark.
