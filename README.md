## How this game works

You decide who to let through the border.

Your resources are limited: rations, security, morale. You can survive hunger longer than your people, but your reputation determines whether they continue to follow you.

You must survive for *ten days*. After that, the N.A.L. ALLIES, the nearest surviving federation, will reach your borders to unite with your region. Until then, you stand alone, a flickering light in the dark.
